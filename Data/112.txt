Posted by: mysalsa on Nov 12, 08 at 12:55 PM Posted in: Asia Tagged: Thailand Jump to last reply Add a Reply Report Abuse Printer Friendly Hello everyone! Just found a great deal to Thailand and would like to go for 10 days in February. However, like most in the U.S., I am struggling with the poor economy. My question is this, how much is our dollar worth in Thailand? Yes, I know the exchange rate, but I am just wondering if that rate will actually get us far. How much is the average dinner in US Dollars? Or taxi? Or souvenirs? Thanks for all your help in advance! 9 Replies | Jump to bottom Add a Reply Report Abuse rhkkmk on Nov 12, 08 at 01:03 PM you could have a dinner for as little as $5 each or you could have a fantastic $200 (american price) dinner for about $75-80..... we have very good thai dinners for $20-30 for two with 2 or 3 beers split.....wine is still very expensive so avoid it....a glass of fair wine might be $10-12....a bottle you would pay $10 for in usa would be $50-60 in bkk.... a fabulous luncheon bufet at lord jim restaurant in the oriental is about $27-30 per person, and it is soup to nuts and more.... hotel prices have risen quite a bit in the last two years but there are still tons of bargains.... look at these sites: www.asiarooms.com www.huahin.20m.com listed by address www.agoda.com we will be glad to assist you....ask us about hotels before you make your res... some good choices: bangkok holiday inn on plenochit majestic grande marriott resort and spa hilton marriott courtyard--new do you have any hotel points? especially sheratons can be useful in bkk...

Hotel prices have gone up a lot in Thailand, but you can still live in the lap of luxury in Thailand for the price of a mediocre hotel in the US. Taxis ($1-2 for most rides, $10 from the airport) and public transport (we rode the skytrain for a week for $10)are cheap. Food is excellent and very reasonably priced. Lunch (our main meal of the day) at one of our favorite restaurants was about $15. Also, spa services are well-priced. We did 2.5 hour
