It was one of the most glorious of the Italian Comuni during the Middle Ages. It housed one of Italy’s most spectacular courts during the Renaissance. And so on. Leonardo da Vinci came from Florence looking for work and ended up staying a long time and achieving quite a lot, like many others have done since. Having always been in the thick of things, Milano is gifted with an impressive part of Italy’s heritage: it is a great city of art.   Have a look at the imposing marble Duomo, at our churches, palaces and museums. You will also be delighted by contemporary art and architecture. Countless works of art are waiting for you, and nearly all of them are within walking distance.   While you visit, let the atmosphere of Italy’s most modern and advanced city seep in. You will be captured by the elegance and style; by the energy and the international flair. An incredible shopping experience for all tastes and pockets, in a place where design and fashion have made their home.   Milan is the hub of Italian culture, music, media and sports. If you are a music lover, you can’t miss La Scala. If you are a sports fan, no other city can probably boast two soccer powerhouses like Inter Milan and AC Milan. With so many things to do and see, take the time to simply enjoy yourself – relax and sip an aperitivo while you consider your options for dinner. Milan provides an overwhelming dining experience, as all Italian regional cuisines are richly represented, along with many others from the rest of the world.     Milano is warming up in advance for the great event, which will transform the city in the key international gateway to Italy and all its beauties. From stunning mountain vistas to crystal clear Mediterranean waters, Italy has something for everyone: Milan will be proud to introduce the world to a country where thousands of years of history have shaped a way of life that is renowned worldwide for its attractions, its food and its lifestyle. And if you want to know Italy, Milan is the best possible place to start.   Best hotels in Milan Ibis Milano Centro from €64 Armani Hotel Milano from €398 Best Western Hotel Galles from €100 Hotel Chateau Monfort from €142 Boscolo Milano Autograph Collection from €248 NH Hotel Touring Milan from €93 More hotels Milan image gallery Tours & Activities in Milan more activities Top things to do in Milan The Duomo and Milan's cultural heritage Everyone is familiar with the spectacular Cathedral that dominates the centre of the city, but not everyone knows that it is possible to walk up onto the terraces of the Duomo di Milano and gaze on the city's rooftops, admiring the countless brooding statues resting on their pinnacles. Nor does everyone know that Milan houses a wealth of Italy's artistic heritage in its ancient churches and in its museums, and that important art exhibitions are always on show.     Domo Copyright Guatman Leonardo in Milan Something definitely not to be missed on a visit to Milan is the work of Leonardo da Vinci, who lived in the city at the court of Ludovico il Moro. But there's a lot more to it than just the world-famous Last Supper: look up Leonardo's extraordinary sketches on the Codex Atlanticus, part of which is always on display at the Biblioteca Ambrosiana, his hydraulic work on Milan's old canals, the display of his discoveries at the Science and Technology Museum, and many other traces of his stay both within the city and in its surroundings. Copyright Emilio Dellepiane Fashion & Shopping Milan is world famous for fashion and style: you can simply enjoy it by strolling along the streets of the city and admiring the windows of the great designers. Find the perfect dress or bargain to take home with you. During Fashion Week the city offers unique experiences in all the right places: the famous Fashion District, the elegant half-hidden streets, the display windows of the famous brands, the historical artisan shops, Galleria Vittorio Emanuele with its luxury labels and the more mainstream shopping streets.   Copyright Mike and Annabel Beales Design Design is an integral part of Milanese culture. A considerable number of museums, studios and private archives are an important testimony to the city’s history and its patrimony. An opportunity to see tomorrow’s trends at the same time as the history that generated them. In Milan design is also a life style. There are plenty of places to spend some leisure time surrounded by Italian and international design masterpieces; restaurants, hotels and many other places where, above all else, it is style that counts. And don’t miss during your stay the Triennale Design Museum: it is unique in Italy, exhibiting Italian design in a cycle of exhibitions which are renewed every year.   Copyright Dimitri B Aperitivo Milano by Night kicks off at sunset with the Happy Hour, a time of day when all the city bars compete to offer the best cocktails skilfully prepared by their expert barmen. Getting together in the evening for a drink is a Milanese custom. It’s both a trendy ritual and a chance to enjoy a drink and satisfy your appetite without spending a fortune.     Turismo Milano Video of Milan Destinations Milan Best of Europe Best Destinations 2016 Best ski resorts in Europe Best Christmas markets Best beaches in Europe Cheap hotel deals in Europe Cheap flights to Europe European Best Destinations About us Contact us Membership E-tourism Barometer Download Press Connect with us Subscribe to discover latest travel inspiration, tips and deals from European Best Destinations.
