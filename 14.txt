You can  start your journey in Zagreb and explore the lakes of Plitvice, Zadar, Dubrovnik, Split, Opatija and take your plane back from the airport of Pula or Dubrovnik.   Anyway, travelling by car is the most comfortable way to enjoy your trip.   Rent a car When to go in Zagreb and Croatia? The best time to visit Croatia is between April and October. You have 7 beautiful months to discover this wonderful country and enjoy its climate.
